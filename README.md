## 🚀 About the Project

TomFi is a demo banking web application that opened doors to new opportunities and played a key role in my personal growth as a developer.
Throughout this project, I've explored:

- 🔁 **SvelteKit** for reactive, frontend development
- 🧠 **TypeScript** for static type safety
- 🛢️ **MariaDB** for reliable SQL storage
- 🔒 **Symmetric & Asymmetric hashing** for data protection
- 🔄 **Database transactions** to ensure consistency
- 🧩 **Custom middlewares** for request processing
- 🔒 **Backend Validation** for Maximum Security
